            The community around us is also part of us as we help in cleaning of our markets and shopping centers, our rivers, etc... We also have tree planting and mentor-ship programs in our local primary and secondary schools, which is our way of giving back to our society.
            Conservation of our environment is close to us as we lead in promoting awareness on conservation of our mother earth; our tree planting activities both in and out of our university is geared towards increasing the national tree cover to reduce the impacts of climate change regionally, nationally and globally.
